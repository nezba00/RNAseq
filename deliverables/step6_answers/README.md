## In this folder are the answerfiles to step 6
Summary files for novel and novel significant transcripts --> step6_answers*
Contain number of:

--> correct tss annotation

--> correct poly-A annotation 

--> intergenic transcripts

--> number of non protein coding transcripts


Tables with transcripts and information about TSS, PolyA, intergenic, and protein coding bool
step6_sig_lnc.tsv --> significant lncRNAs, novel an knwon
step6_sig_novel_lnc.tsv --> significant novel lncRNAs
step6_sorted_novel.tsv --> all novel transcripts
--> Columns for TSS, PolyA, intergenic, and protein coding bool are only relevant for novel transcripts!


Simple excel table with a plot from a table that was used in the paper.
