## In this folder are the answerfiles to step 6
Summary files for novel and novel significant transcripts
Contain number of:

--> correct tss annotation

--> correct poly-A annotation 

--> intergenic transcripts

--> number of non protein coding transcripts


Tables with transcripts and information about TSS, PolyA, intergenic, and protein coding bool

--> Columns for TSS, PolyA, intergenic, and protein coding bool are only relevant for novel transcripts!
